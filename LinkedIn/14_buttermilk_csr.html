    <p class="padding"> During my holidays, I went shopping in a crowded bazaar in my hometown.</p>

    <p class="padding">The summer had just begun, and it was hot. A store wanted to help people in a small way. It had a
        stall at the front and distributed buttermilk for free to people passing by.</p>

    <p class="padding">Pamphlets mentioning the products/offers of the store were also kept on the stall. </p>

    <p class="padding">Some left as soon as they drank, but a good number enquired about the offers and went in.</p>

    <p class="padding">The buttermilk quenched the thirst of the passersby, as well as brought new customers into the
        store.</p>

    <p class="padding">Some companies involve in CSR activities solely to help people, but a few find a way to take-up
        CSR to help people as well as benefit the business.</p>

    <p class="padding">Project Shakthi empowering women, Annapurna iodized salt improving health, Nike waterless dye
        technology saving water found a way.</p>

    <p class="padding">So did the small store with ten-odd employees.</p>
