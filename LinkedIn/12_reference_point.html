        <p align='center'>Reference Points</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding"> A reference point is a point in the past which is compared to the present day. Good movies
        unlock the different reference points of life. Some of which may be unknown to self. </p>

    <p class="padding">A common factor in movies appealing to a broader audience is the right reference points. </p>

    <p class="padding">M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, a hit. Most, irrespective of the differences, can relate to father
        working hard, wanting to follow the passion, having to take a tough career decision, etc. </p>

    <p class="padding">Once we are made to relate at some level to the protagonist by the reference points; we feel that
        we are running a similar trajectory to the protagonist. </p>

    <p class="padding">The reference point may be an episode as a kid, and we don't consider it as a reference anymore,
        but we adhere to it because of the feel-good factor of the movie. </p>

    <p class="padding">Higher the number of reference points with the target audience, wider the audience reach. </p>

    <p class="padding">Some of the best marketing lessons can be learned by observing movies.</p>
