        <p align='center'>Amazon Pantry</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding">While wanting to order a product in Amazon pantry, I came across products from Solimo and Tata.
        If it had been a retail store, I wouldn't have bothered to check out the Solimo product because I hardly heard
        about it.</p>

    <p class="padding">But it's Amazon, and like every customer, I wanted to feel 'smart' by picking the 'best' product.
    </p>

    <p class="padding">The reviews of Solimo's product were higher than that of Tata's product. I was confused. I
        purchased Tata's but not before questioning a hundred years of legacy because of a couple of reviews.</p>

    <p class="padding">The battle between the Amazon-owned private labels such as Solimo, Amazon basics, and the
        established products is in the nascent stage, and Amazon has the upper hand. </p>

    <p class="padding">Amazon's algorithm controls the display of the products on the website. It also manages the
        reviews which affect the product's image. In other words, the battle is fought on Amazon's turf.</p>

    <p class="padding">With all the qualitative data in the form of reviews, Amazon can also make more products that
        acknowledge the suggestions and complaints of millions of people. </p>

    <p class="padding">Manufacturers who get swayed by the growth in the e-commerce sector and mobile penetration in the
        country and don't give attention to the retail formats are at high risk of losing their strong foothold in the
        market.</p>
