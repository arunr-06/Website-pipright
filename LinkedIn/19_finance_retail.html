        <p align='center'>Banking in the lens of Retail</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding"> Using Feynman's technique to simplify and understand the banking business by likening it to
        retailing.

    <p class="padding">Retailer buys products from manufacturers and sells them to customers. Similarly, bank
    receives money from central banks and lends it to people in need.

    <p class="padding">Retailer aims to improve profit, while bank aims to improve the 'spread' — the difference
    between the central bank rate and the rate charged to customers.

    <p class="padding"> From a bank's risk manager’s perspective, risk management in retail involves tracking products
        that take a long time to sell—so long, in fact, that it would have made more sense to simply deposit the money
        in a bank. Worse yet, some products end up unsold, similar to bad loans that can't be recovered by the bank.

    <p class="padding"> New products pose a risk, so retailers set higher margins to compensate. Banks do the same by
        setting higher interest rates to cover the risks associated with new businesses.

    <p class="padding"> The return policy in retail functions as a hedging instrument, similar to a put option in
        banking. In retail, manufacturers agree to take back unsold or near-expiry products if the retailer requests it.
        In banking, a put option allows the owner to sell stock at a predetermined price if the value is expected to
        drop.

    <p class="padding"> Most businesses are invariably the same upon close observation.
