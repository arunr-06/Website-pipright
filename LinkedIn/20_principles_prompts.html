        <p align='center'>First Principles or First Prompts?</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding"> Imagine a public servant gently nudging someone fast asleep on a park bench meant for people to sit and relax. He'd use a stick, not a knife or a gun. In their earliest stage, guns with all their charm would have positioned themselves as the best weapon under all circumstances. But slowly, people would have realized their folly. 

    <p class="padding">SQL is the stick. Python is the knife. AI agents are machine guns. 

        <h2><p class="padding">Learning has never been more fun:</h2>
    <p class="padding">I like ChatGPT and frequent it regularly. I find it remarkably good at putting up with my petty questions - one on top of another - until I understand a concept from first principles. 

    <p class="padding"> It has made learning fun, easy, and effective.

    <p class="padding"> But in rare cases, without learning the concept deeply, I piece together a solution with a couple of prompts just to get the task done and please my subjects. Not surprisingly, I feel hollow when I have to ask about it again at the onset of a similar task in the future - not a single input but a handful of them - time-consuming and building no knowledge. 

    <p class="padding"> Learn, then do.
<h2> <p class="padding">Original thoughts only: </h2>
    <p class="padding"> Art is under attack. Authenticity is questioned.

<p class="padding">Any work sounding similar to an AI-generated one is under the radar of naysayers who are quick to label the artist as being 'unoriginal'.

<p class="padding">I made a rough draft of this work on my OneNote over the weekends, and I have been itching ever since to post it on social media. My fear harbors around a secret API that fetches my words and passes them to an AI model as training data. Any later than a few days (or hours), my words become part of the mainstream internet and I the guy who stole from it. Better to post it ASAP!

<p class="padding">Surely it must be in terms and conditions - but it’s a lot to read - except for people in high buildings in big cities in their neatly fitted clothes - talking about those lawyers in Suits. Anyway, terms and conditions are a good use case - read through terms and conditions and elaborate on the points that are potentially overlooked and dangerous - without having to copy-paste the whole thing into a prompt.

<h2><p class="padding">Palace made of wax:</h2>
<p class="padding">Well known argument against AI is the accountability problem. Litigation could be drawn against lawyers or doctors for poor work, but not against a product that could potentially do some of their work?

<p class="padding">It doesn’t help when the very people building it, hoping to appear realistic and trustworthy, caution against its potentially destructive effects, only to add that its rise is inevitable.

<p class="padding">AI use cases are aplenty - some of which feel like darts thrown into the unknown, hoping to hit a target of essence. An app supposedly claims to predict how successful an individual will be based on facial structure. As you might have guessed, it often predicts incorrectly - the same person scores better in front of a bookshelf wearing glasses than without them. Simplistic enough. What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can’t

<p class="padding">Withstanding its accuracy, it's novelty is captivating and the possibilities are endless. It's akin to wax clay in the hands of a kid. Can build cute things with it. But palace? Cautionary tale: the palace made of wax in the Mahabharata. It burned.

<p class="padding">I may sound like an AI skeptic right now. But, I change my opinions faster than Elon patching with Trump.
