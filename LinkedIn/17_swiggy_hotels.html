        <p align='center'>Small Restaurants on Swiggy</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding"> Small restaurants are on a level playing field with established chain restaurants on Swiggy
        owing to tasty food and ratings.</p>

    <p class="padding">Swiggy takes only a small portion as a charge and keeps the owners happy right now. A while
        later, Swiggy could start charging more. It may blame the external factors/market conditions.</p>

    <p class="padding">Swiggy may enforce peak pricing/ surge pricing concept like in Uber. </p>

    <p class="padding">The small restaurant owners will be similar to the customers riding in the cab.</p>

    <p class="padding">The owners can't refuse the higher fee because they need to pay the monthly dues to keep up with
        the lifestyle â€” single branch restaurant with two tables served many in the neighborhood and increased revenue
        manifold. </p>

    <p class="padding">Small restaurants owners need to use the increased visibility as a lever to establish the
        business and saturate the dependency on Swiggy; else every day may become a peak pricing day.</p>
