    <p class="padding">A gore scene in a movie may be appealing to my friend whereas I might want it to be toned down a
        bit. Theatres can't help it, but Netflix can. </p>

    <p class="padding">In India, movie outing has traditionally been the go-to thing on the weekends. Watching a movie
        together makes people feel connected. Netflix is all set to divide this group. </p>

    <p class="padding">A Netflix movie named Black Mirror: Bandersnatch lets people choose the experience they want. It
        makes them feel they are in control by allowing them to decide the actions of the protagonist with the click of
        a button.</p>

    <p class="padding">In a world, where data is termed the new oil, this could work wonders for Netflix. </p>

    <p class="padding">Previously, Netflix knew if the film as a whole is doing good, but now they'd know which scenes
        are preferred by movie-watchers and make movies accordingly. </p>

    <p class="padding">Games made a big jump when interactive content was introduced to make people feel empowered.
        Netflix could well be on a similar trajectory. </p>

    <p class="padding">The possibilities are endless.</p>
