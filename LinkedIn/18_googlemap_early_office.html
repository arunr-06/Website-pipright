        <p align='center'>Google Map as Dashboard</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding"> Traveling in car to work in the early hours of the day to beat traffic. Worried about the
        traffic so much so that I skip bath, dress up, breakfast and get it all done after I reach office. Every
        additional minute’s delay in the start time leads to 5–10 additional minutes in the car as traffic rises
        mirroring the sunrise.</p>

    <p class="padding"> Google Maps is my go-to tool to navigate under this high pressure time.</p>

    <p class="padding"> It provides many utilities in addition to navigation. Most useful among them — Destination
        Arrival Time.</p>

    <p class="low_padding"> What is the current time?</p>
    <p class="low_padding"> What is the speed of the vehicle?</p>
    <p class="low_padding">What is the distance left to be covered?</p>
    <p class="low_padding">How does the traffic ahead look?</p>

    <p class="padding">It bundles up all the above to arrive at a number that determines whether I solve the problem at
        hand — in this case, reaching office on time.</p>

    <p class="padding"> If not for this leading indicator, I’d be investing precious mind compute to predict the arrival
        time while driving.</p>

    <p class="padding"> How I wish data dashboards were that simple? Just one data point to zero in on.</p>

    <p class="padding"> Not multitude of visuals answering one-off cases — what if the tyres wear out? what if the ride
        is upgraded? Nor plain SUMIF aggregations that don’t address the problem at hand readily.</p>

    <p class="padding"> Just one leading indicator that does all the grunt work and lets me know if I’m on time.</p>
