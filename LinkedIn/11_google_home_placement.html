    </h1>
    <p class="padding"></p>When I open Google Chrome browser, I have different websites lined up in the homepage. </p>

    <p class="padding">I see Gmail at the top left. It is the most important one. I click it as soon as I open the
        laptop in the morning. Easy to identify and right at the top.</p>

    <p class="padding">At the bottom right, I see Netflix. I usually use Netflix at night, like most others. </p>

    <p class="padding">While lying on a bed, it's easier to click the one on the right side bottom corner than it is to
        click the one on the left side for a right-hander.</p>

    <p class="padding">The effort for moving the cursor diagonally down seems lesser than moving it diagonally up.</p>

    <p class="padding">Not sure if Google positioned it purposely, but it works great. </p>

    <p class="padding">Initially, I assumed the arrangement of sites was based on the frequency or duration of use, but
        that's not the case. I use Amazon and a few other sites much less compared to Netflix, but Netflix has the
        bottom-most position.</p>

    <p class="padding">The positioning of sites in homepage seems very trivial, but it improves the experience- a key
        reason for Google's success. </p>
