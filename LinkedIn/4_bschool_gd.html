    </h1>
    <p class="padding">The notion that one can do well in the Group Discussion round of a B-School final placement
    by preparing on the days leading to it seems flawed.</p>

    <p class="padding">In my limited experience, I believe that one of the essential attributes recruiters look for in a
        candidate is the respect he/she has amongst his/her peer group. </p>

    <p class="padding">Not the respect one presumes he/she gets by being loud or abrasive during a GD. </p>

    <p class="padding">The respects one earns over the two years by participating in the class discussions and enriching
        it by providing key insights constantly. </p>

    <p class="padding">Peers look up to such a person while at a GD. </p>

    <p class="padding">While that person speaks, others hear him/her out and nod as a sign of approval.
        While they speak, they constantly look at that person and seek his/her approval.</p>

    <p class="padding">It's spontaneous and instinctive. It is a sign of respect.</p>

    <p class="padding">Excellent communication skills, articulation skills, tone, domain knowledge are important. </p>

    <p class="padding">But one that is never talked about and is grossly undervalued is the respect of the peers. </p>

    <p class="padding">It is not attained overnight. It takes effort from day 1.</p>
