    <p class="padding"> Explaining a fitness hack using the Return on equity (ROE) concept to a Finance-major friend of
        mine. </p>

    <p class="padding">According to studies, one with muscles is likely to lose more fat than one with no muscles by
        running the same distance. </p>

    <p class="padding">When debt is introduced into the capital structure, it is likely to improve the ROE. ROE is
        obtained by dividing net income to equity.</p>

    <p class="padding">Running a business with debt improves the return on equity. Similarly, running after building
        muscles improves fat loss. </p>

    <p class="padding">Fat loss is ROE and muscle is debt.</p>
