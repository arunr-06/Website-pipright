        <p align='center'>Indigo Complimentary Snack</p>
    </h1>

    <p class="padding">When I travel by most domestic airlines, I receive a complimentary snack. Usually bread with jam
        and artificial fruit juice. Most often, I avoid eating it, and I have noticed the same behaviour with many other
        passengers too.</p>

    <p class="padding">As a consumer, I don’t like to book tickets of a carrier whose food service is forced upon me.
    </p>

    <p class="padding">Though the cost of the snack is minimal, it bothers me, as it may have cut the prices marginally
        if the snack wasn't bundled with the airline service.</p>

    <p class="padding">Since, we Indians are price conscious, every single rupee matters.</p>

    <p class="padding">IndiGo gets it and doesn't provide a complimentary snack to its customers.</p>

    <p class="padding">This strategy serves both types of customers.</p>

    <p class="padding">Those who don’t want to eat will feel relieved that they have not paid for the snack, and others
        who want to eat will not be burdened with having to fight their conscience to spend money on a snack in spite of
        having received a free snack.</p>

    <p class="padding">Gone are the days, when consumers wanted products/services clubbed. Today’s consumers are
        specific about their needs and are reluctant to let the company decide it.</p>

    <p class="padding">Imagine booking a seat in a movie theatre after a meal, knowing that a snack will be added to the
        movie ticket by default. Doesn’t feel good right?</p>
