        <p align='center'>Reverse Assumption</p>
    </h1>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">One of the exciting things that I learned in my Strategic Thinking and Problem Solving class is
        Reverse Assumption.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">It begins with listing assumptions about a given subject and then challenging the assumptions by
        reversing them.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Amazon is a prime example.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Assumption: Need stores to sell products
        Reversal: No stores are needed to sell products
        Idea: The Internet</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">While pondering over the idea of Reverse Assumption, I wanted to note a few things. I usually
        prefer MS Word, but I have been switching to Grammarly in recent times.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">It made me realize that Grammarly is yet another example of Reverse Assumption and is an
        excellent product idea.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">While competitors of Word were busy improving the features and finding ways to make customers
        download it, Grammarly realized that they needn't follow the traditional path.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">What did they do? </p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Rather than forcing customers to download the product, they made it accessible via the Internet.
        No extra features, no download, no memory needed. Just a platform to write things with good grammar.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">It is highly likely that people start using Grammarly more profoundly than MS Word in the coming
        months.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Now, thatâ€™s one way of thinking of a product idea. Using Reverse Assumption to disrupt the
        market.</p>
