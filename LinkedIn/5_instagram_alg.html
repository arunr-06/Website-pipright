        <p align='center'>Instagram Algorithm</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding">The Instagram algorithm may be the smartest fund manager ever. </p>

    <p class="padding">When I press the search button on the bottom left of the Instagram app, I mostly get three types
        of posts- my favorite football team, favorite actor, and fitness related. </p>

    <p class="padding">The algorithm read that these are my favorites by the number of clicks/views I have had on such
        posts over time. </p>

    <p class="padding">Sometimes, I want to see posts of the football team only. </p>

    <p class="padding">One might think that I am likely to get more of the football team posts as I keep clicking such
        posts and scroll down looking for more of it. </p>
    <p class="padding">But Instagram shows more posts of my other favorites.</p>

    <p class="padding">It diversifies its risk.</p>

    <p class="padding">If I'm allowed to see only posts of the football team like I want to, I might lose interest in
        Instagram when the football team performs poorly on a given matchday/season.</p>

    <p class="padding">Instagram can't afford it. </p>

    <p class="padding">Like a diligent fund manager who spreads the customer's investment on the different funds based
        on the investment policy statement decided by the customer, the algorithm sticks to the number of posts based on
        the customer's favorites. Neither more nor less. </p>

    <p class="padding">One difference is the obligation. The fund manager has the fiduciary responsibility to act in the
        best interest of his/her customers.</p>

    <p class="padding">But, Instagram, we'll never know.</p>
