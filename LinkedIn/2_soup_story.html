        <p align='center'>Soup Story</p>
    </h1>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Ordered soup in a restaurant and realized that it was not to my liking, so I had a chat with the
        server. The server cleared the air about the dish, and it turned out that I got confused between two similar
        dishes.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p class="padding">The server could have very well opted to do nothing about it because there was no fault on his
        side.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p class="padding">But he saw the slightest discomfort in my face and decided to act on it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p class="padding">He brought extra sauces and veggies to spice my next dish. He also had a brief chat about the
        health benefits of eating onions when he saw that I hadn't been eating it. The conversation would have been
        unnecessary if I was in a hurry. But since I was dressed in pajamas and didn't have my phone, he knew I'd be up
        for a chat.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p class="padding">The server was an old man and has been observing customers for over a decade. He was courteous in
        providing the right amount of attention to deal with the situation.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p class="padding">And by the time, I left the restaurant, I forgot all about the soup. All I remembered was the
        warmth in which the food was served.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p class="padding">The episode made me realize that Service Marketing is an art that can be learned only with
        experience and one that cannot be learned in class.
