        <p align='center'>YouTube Audio</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="padding"> Always wondered the reason behind YouTube not letting users listen to audio in the phone lock
        mode.</p>

    <p class="padding">A few years back, videos were meant to be seen at home in computers and not on mobile devices on
        the go.</p>

    <p class="padding">Today, YouTube is the leading video streaming service. It reached the position owing to the
        formation of behavior among its users- watch videos anytime and anyplace with good quality.</p>

    <p class="padding">Was traveling in metro and realized that if YouTube had added the feature-audio in the lock mode,
        I would have listened rather than watching the content.</p>

    <p class="padding">Gradually, I might get used to the idea of using YouTube as an audio service.</p>

    <p class="padding">Advertisements are a vital revenue source and made to please visually, even if it's for a few
        seconds. It is a lost purpose for YouTube if I use it in lock mode.</p>

    <p class="padding">YouTube music has been introduced recently, but audio streaming is a crowded segment with the
        likes of Spotify, Apple music, etc. Tough to garner high market share. No notable threat in video streaming.</p>

    <p class="padding">The slightest risk of hurting the behavior of users and having to compete in a crowded
        segment(audio streaming) with a feature(audio) that is not it's strongest may be the reason YouTube never wanted
        us to hear just the audio.</p>
