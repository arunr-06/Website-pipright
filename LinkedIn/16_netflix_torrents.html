    <p class="padding"> Read a report which stated that Netflix analyzes torrent data before adding a movie to the site.
        Thoughtful.</p>

    <p class="padding">Parameters such as revenue, running days, reviews, etc. have the possibility of being skewed
        based on factors beyond the watchers like. External influence is present. </p>

    <p class="padding">Torrent data is unaltered. None checks the number of times a movie is downloaded in torrents
        before opting to go for a movie. </p>

    <p class="padding">Hence, there is no practical purpose for parties to meddle with the torrent data. </p>

    <p class="padding">Movie makers are more willing to release soon in Netflix nowadays given that piracy/ torrent
        starts eating a chunk of revenue, days after release.</p>

    <p class="padding">Not so long ago, torrent seemed to be a significant roadblock for Netflix. Like other great
        companies, Netflix proved that a roadblock could be a boon if one looks at it the right way.</p>
