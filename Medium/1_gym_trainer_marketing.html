        <b>WEEK 1</b>:
    <p class="padding">
        It was Friday, and the weekend was beaming.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        Looked for gyms near me over the internet.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        Found a one to my liking and filled out the online form to get a free trial.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        Received a call from the gym trainer the following day.
        Agreed to check out the gym on Sunday evening.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        I was supposed to reach at 6.30.
        Took me 10 minutes longer, and I get a check-up call from the trainer.
        Hmmm. Strange.
        Informed him that I’m just around the corner.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        Reached and looked around the gym.
        Fantastic place.
        Decided to take up the trial the following Saturday.
        Shook hands with the trainer and left.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        <b>WEEK 2:</b>
    <p class="padding">
        On Thursday, the trainer texts to confirm my arrival on Saturday.
        Follow up for a free trial?
        Quite surprised.
        I check with him on the no-charges thing.
        Trainer confirms.
        Not sure about my plans for the weekend as yet, so I don’t confirm my arrival.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        On Saturday, he texts again to see what time I’d come in.
        I get the feeling that he’d be unhappy when I walk away after the free trial.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        To cool things down, I let him know that I’ll not be able to make it. Could come in next week maybe.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        I expected him to give up but got a quick response to check my preferred day.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        I was taken aback.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        So persistent to give away a trial?
        Not like I’m going to pay up.
        If anything, I’m going to use his facilities for free.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        I let him know that I’d confirm in a couple of days.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">
        <b>WEEK 3</b>:
    <p class="padding">
        I get a text on Thursday checking if I’m still interested in the trial.
    <p class="padding">
        I like this guy’s persistence.
        I confirm that I’d come in on Friday evening.
    <p class="padding">
        On Friday noon, another text from him to confirm my arrival.
        I wasn’t surprised anymore.
    <p class="padding">
        I went in and did my solo workout.
        It was extraordinary.
        After the session, I was not made to sit and hear the plans, thankfully.
        I was quite hungry.
        I made my way home right after my workout.
    <p class="padding">
        I waited for the trainer to message me.
        I was sure he was going to check when I was going to sign up for the membership.
    <p class="padding">
        No message until noon the next day.
        I lose my patience and message him.
        Thanked him for setting up the rewarding workout session and requested details of the 1-month package.
        He was pleased and asked if I could drop by.
        I intended to respond later.
    <p class="padding">
        <b>WEEK 4</b>:
    <p class="padding">
        Things came up, so I wasn’t sure if it was a good idea to sign up.
        Got a call on Tuesday and was offered a good deal.
        1-month package but with strings attached. Good ones.
        If I was to sign up on the week, I could use the gym for the remainder of the month for free.
        I’d only need to pay for July.
        Free for 6 days.
        Though appealing, I asked him to give me some time to think about it.
    <p class="padding">
        Been two days and I hadn’t responded.
        Pretty surprised that I didn’t hear from the over-enthusiastic trainer either.
        I thought he would be pressured to convert this free trial into a plan.
        Was expecting him to follow up vigorously, but nope.
    <p class="padding">
        After careful consideration, I make up my mind.
        I can’t go ahead because of other priorities so conveyed it to him and thanked him for the assistance.
        Received a Welcome!
    <p class="padding">
        Really, one with an exclamation!
    <p class="padding">
        The trainer’s efforts did seem to have gone in vain, but I gave it a good consideration. If the situation had
        been favorable, I would have jumped at this opportunity.
    <p class="padding">
        I was particularly impressed by the trainer’s rather patient approach in converting the trial to a paid
        membership.
    <p class="padding">
    Quite a few lessons learned from the episode:
    <p class="padding">
        <i>
            1) When offering something for free, be proactive, and persistent. When expecting something in return,
            exercise
            patience.
            <p class="padding">
                2) Market it forcefully. Sell it gently.
            <p class="padding">
                3) Understand limitations.
                Ensuring many people know about the product is within one’s control. Getting paid for it is dependent on
                factors
                beyond control.
            <p class="padding">
                4) Give people their sweet own time to reflect and make decisions, especially when it involves money.
