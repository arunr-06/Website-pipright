    </h1>
    <h2>
        <p class="padding">Problem statement:</p>
    </h2>
    <p class="padding">The active percentage of Instacash's user base has stagnated at ~40%. In other words, of all
        recent Instacash users, only 40% are still actively using it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <p class="padding">Background:
    </h2>
    <p class="padding">Instacash is a wage access product allowing users to access a portion of their pay 14 days before
        payday.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">Money is credited to the user's bank account (3-5 days) or MoneyLion's Roarmoney account (1-2
        days) as per the user's choice. It can be credited instantly for a nominal fee—also called turbo fees; fees are
        slightly higher to credit to a bank account.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">Instead of a traditional credit check, the app reviews transactions in the user's salary account
        before dispersing the amount.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">On payday, money is debited automatically from the user's bank account. If money is unavailable,
        a late fee charge may apply, though no late fee chart is available in the public domain.
    </p>
    <p class="padding">The paid version of the app, MoneyLion Plus, includes Roarinvest, which manages the user's
        investment portfolio.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <p class="padding">Analysis:
    </h2>
    <h3>
        <p class="padding">Use case 1: get to their next month's salary first
    </h3>
    <p class="padding">

        Increase the Instacash limit and allow users to use Instacash to invest in Roarinvest - either one-time or
        recurring. Quite similar to SIPs, but MoneyLion gets to the user before others; 14 days earlier.

    <p class="padding">

        User A doesn't hold a MoneyLion app and receives $1000 on payday. Pays a total of $500 for debt and recurring
        expenses like educational loans and home rent. Reluctant to invest a portion of the remaining because unsure
        about upcoming expenses.

    <p class="padding">

        User B holds a MoneyLion app and receives $1000 on payday. 14 days before payday, $200 posted to Roarinvest from
        Instacash. On payday, $200 deducted from salary account to repay the Instacash loan. Pays a total of $500 for
        debt and recurring expenses, leaving $300 for the rest of the month. Spends it freely, knowing full well that
        all obligations are met and that Instacash is ready to lend a helping hand if more expenses arise.

    <p class="padding">

        Users get 14 days of returns even without paying any money upfront. Jackpot.

    <p class="padding">

        Moneylion's Roarinvest holds the cash, hence the flexibility to increase limits. Users who default could be
        locked out from withdrawing the investment portfolio. No stress.

    <p class="padding">

        Data points:
    <p class="padding">
        1. Proportion of users with balance in their salary account, yet pausing SIPs because of potential expenses.
        Greater than 0 is an opportunity.



    <h3>
        <p class="padding">Use case 2: Instacash for e-commerce transactions
    </h3>
    <p class="padding">

        Allow users to purchase products on e-commerce platforms using Instacash.

    <p class="padding">

        User A is interested in buying a product from a third-party e-commerce site but is low on cash. Considers using
        the MoneyLion app, but realizes there is a need to open the MoneyLion app and add money to Roarmoney via
        Instacash to make the purchase; too much friction, so ends up using the Amazon pay later-like option available
        on the e-commerce website.

    <p class="padding">

        Expenses happen spontaneously; it's unplanned, so be there to make the most of it.

    <p class="padding">

        Data points:
    <p class="padding">

        1. Proportion of users utilizing the Instacash amount soon after it’s credited to their account. Higher implies
        impulse needs.

    <h3>
        <p class="padding">Use case 3: grow Roarmoney base
    </h3>
    <p class="padding">

        Instacash is a "bait on the hook to catch the fish."
        Instacash is the bait.
        Roarmoney account is the hook.

    <p class="padding">

        Continue marketing Instacash to ensure more users give it a try.


    <p class="padding">
        Roarmoney account holders get better Instacash rates and provinces, so ideal from a user's perspective to enroll
        for it.
        What could stop them?
        Lengthy process, information disparity.

    <p class="padding">

        Instacash process could be lengthy with all details diligently captured.
        However, the Roarmoney account creation process needs to be quick.
        On the last screen of the Instacash process, provide a single-click option to create a MoneyLion account
        alongside details of what they would miss out on if they choose not to.

    <p class="padding">

        Once they are onboard, they are susceptible to moving portions of their business from other banks to MoneyLion.
        Banking in MoneyLion app is more intuitive - UI and systems. Just need to let them see it.

    <p class="padding">

        Instant cash loaners are a small chunk. Pie is bigger.
    <p class="padding">

    <p class="padding">

        60% inactive Instacash user base is less concerning if Roarmoney account holders constitute a higher percentage
        of it.
    <p class="padding">
        Data points:
    <p class="padding">

        1. Proportion of Roarmoney account holders amongst the Instacash users for the years in question.
