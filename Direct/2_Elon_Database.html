    <p>
    <p class="padding">"Fundamental weakness in the government – various government databases don't talk to each other; they talk to each other poorly; so the system gets exploited by taking advantage of poor communications between the various databases." - Elon Musk on the Joe Rogan podcast.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Governments are massive requiring tons of systems.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Building those systems is hard.<br>
Making them talk to each other?<br>
Even harder.<br>
It takes intent, interoperability, and consistent data management.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Inefficiencies arise when systems don’t align.<br>
When there’s no traceability.<br>
When databases don’t sync in real time.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Companies face similar issues too.<br>
But they often brute-force their way out with enough engineers, compute, and dashboards.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">In governments, that option is not as readily available.</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">The result?</p>
    <p>
    <p class="padding">Inaccurate numbers.<br>
Poor targeting.<br>
Leaks.<br>
Exploits.</p>
